# Intro Data-Bases 451-term-project

The idea behind the term project is to create a small program in any language (we chose C#)
that can holds a database that can be filtered and searched through. Parsing will be done in
python and the database will done in SQL.

Currently the project is in its beggining stages, as more is added the description will become
longer and more detailed.
******

***Project***

The project is based of the "Yelp challenge" and the end goal is to use parts of the data set 
provided for our program.
******

***User***

The idea is to be able to allow users to find businesse, rate them,
favourite them, review, checkin into them and just in general interact with them. The distance,
to each business will be shown.

Each user will also have a list of favourite Businesses, and friends.
******

***Business***

Every business will have the same attributes, but all will have different values for them
depending on the business and what it has. Some may only serve lunch and have wifi, other
serve from breakfast through to dinner and have deserts, are child friendly and offer takeout.
There is multitude of possibilities but each of these attributes will allow the user to
choose a better business for what he is looking for depending on what he needs.
